- [x] operationalize rtc negotiation!
  - concurrent rtc negotiations will get scrambled until we split the process into sessions
- [ ] isolation by origin *and* by room tags
  - by default browser clients can only interact with other browser clients who are on the same origin

  - separate stats for global sparrow usage, and your local app origin's usage
  - consider publicly listing top ten origins by usage load
- [ ] implement operation and negotiation timeouts
- [ ] make working demos
- [ ] finish readme
- [ ] deployment
- [ ] make quick multimedia streaming demo
